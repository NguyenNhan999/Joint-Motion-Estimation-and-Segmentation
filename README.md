# Demo code for "Joint Learning of Motion Estimation and Segmentation for Cardiac MR Image Sequences"

Lasagne and theano implementation of the framework.


main.py ==> main training file

test_prediction ==> applies joint prediction and visualisation

models ==> proposed network and layers

dataio ==> includes loading images, data_augmentation, etc

utils ==> metrics and visualisation

model ==> Model parameters

test ==> One test sample

PyTorch implementation is under construction.
